At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (2,2.0,2) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (1,1.0,1) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 71.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.6,4) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (1,1.5,1) frames.
Overall, AH0_I accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (1,1.0,1) frames.
Overall, IY1_I accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, M_B accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, N_E accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, SH_I accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 14.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
