# Goodness-of-Pronounciation

We use Kaldi's GOP_speechocean recipe to calculate the gop of give audio and utterence.


Download Librispeech model: https://kaldi-asr.org/models/m13

# main.py

1. Create data files for kaldi including wav.scp, utt2spk, utt2text
2. Call run_gop.sh script.
   1. Load acoustic model, language model and ivector extractor model
   2. Feature extraction: Extract MFCC, CMVN, IVECTOR
   3. Compute Log-likelihoods.
   4. Compute alignment.
   5. Using the log-likelihoods and alignment, use compute-gop to calculate gop scores.
3. calculate phone scores. As the gop scores are log likelihoods, we can convert it to regular decimal scale by calculating 10 ^ (log score).
4. Calculate overall score. Calculate overall score by taking average of all phone scores.
5. Get phone timings from exp/ali-phone.1 file.
6. Display the result in json form.

# How to run the script:

python main.py <audio_file_path> <text>

eg. python main.py MACHINE.wav MACHINE
